### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a university assistend at the Institute of Urban Water Management and Landscape Water Engineering at the University of Technology Graz.

Most often i work with hydrology, hydraulic and sewer data comming from measurements or simulations.

I'm a fan of open source software and python and try to publish my scrips and scientific work as open as possible. 

Some of my projects are:
- ehyd_tools
- SWMM_xsections_shape_generator
- intensity_duration_frequency_analysis
- swmm_api (main repository on gitlab)

Some smaller projects (mainly matplotlib plots):
- monthly-calendar-plot
- moody_chart
- head-loss-nomogram

Also have a look at my other repositories on [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/markuspichler).
And see my published ready to use pacakges on [pypi](https://pypi.org/user/markusp/)
